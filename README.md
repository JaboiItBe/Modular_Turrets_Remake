# Modular_Turrets_Remake
Mod for the game CDDA. Adds deployable/craftable turrets variations.


This is an updated version of the automation / modular turrets / makeshift robots

I updated it pretty much for my own use in the span of an hour so things are VERY jank and many shortcuts were taken such as the railgun turret needing only a nail gun
and most turrets not actually being able to be loaded or reloaded by magazine and must be reloaded automaticly on deploy 
BUT it seems to run without errors and on my 5 mins of testing things seemed to be fine on craft and deploy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

forked because I didnt think id get it working

I only removed errors as fast as I could

¯\_(ツ)_/¯


have fun -btw needs aftershock for control laptop/robot start
